# {lifeboat_meta_name} - Dynamic Data Lifeboat

This is a **Dynamic Data Lifeboat Space** that downloads and serves a Data Lifeboat collection at runtime.

## About This Collection

**Purpose:** {lifeboat_meta_purpose}

## How It Works

This Space dynamically downloads the raw Data Lifeboat from:
**[📦 {raw_dataset_repo_id}](https://huggingface.co/datasets/{raw_dataset_repo_id})**

When the Space starts, it:
1. 📥 Downloads the complete Data Lifeboat archive
2. 🚀 Extracts and serves it using Python HTTP server  
3. 🌐 Provides the same interactive experience as the original

## Advantages of Dynamic Hosting

- ✅ **No size limits** - Downloads happen at runtime within HuggingFace's infrastructure
- ✅ **Always fresh** - Pulls the latest version of the Data Lifeboat
- ✅ **Minimal upload** - Only configuration files need to be uploaded to the Space
- ✅ **Preserves integrity** - Raw Data Lifeboat served exactly as archived

## About Data Lifeboats

Data Lifeboats are **self-contained digital preservation archives** from the [Flickr Foundation](https://www.flickr.org/) that preserve complete cultural collections with:

- 📷 Original high-quality photos and thumbnails
- 📝 Complete metadata (titles, descriptions, tags, dates, locations)  
- 🌐 Interactive web viewer with no external dependencies
- 📊 Structured data ready for research and analysis

⚡ **Dynamic hosting** - This Data Lifeboat is downloaded fresh each time the Space starts.

*Technical implementation: Docker Space with runtime dataset download via `huggingface_hub`*
